# GIT
This program is a GIT server and client for storing and versioning files with possibilities to rollback to any version, with self-created serisliser\deserialiser. File transfers wrapped into zip archieve, for less traffic use. There is also factory: 'the only factory you'll ever need', created using java reflect for constructing classes and calling methods from them.

GITServer\GITClient requires SameBody to be impirted => you'll need to make libs from them - that's only code of that application.
